<!-- iframes makes it possible to run an instance of an embedded webpage
in your site -->
<!-- most used for ads, but it also can show other page content like a social media post -->
<!-- can be dangerous because it runs JS from another website
that could be malicious software -->


<!-- the allow attribute can be used to limit the risks -->
<!-- the sandbox attribute is used to place restrictions, if empty all restrictions are applied by default -->
